Yet another simple modification which allows users to filter results as shown by show posts/topics/attachments in the profile section of a user to specific board id(s). For example, if a user decides to filter results to board ids: 3, 4, 5, only results from those boards will be shown. If you have any questions or problems, please message me at the official SMF community as user: [url=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=164151]Project Evolution[/url].
